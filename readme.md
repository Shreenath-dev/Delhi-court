Approach Used

1. User Input via UI

   * The application provides a simple web form where the user enters **Case Type**, **Case Number**, and **Year**.

2. Automated Browsing with Selenium

   * A headless Chrome browser (via Selenium) navigates to the Delhi High Court case search page.
   * Selenium programmatically fills in the form fields and triggers the search.

3. Scraping Results with BeautifulSoup

   * The returned HTML is parsed using BeautifulSoup.
   * Relevant case details are extracted from the results table or section.

4. PDF Detection & Download

   * The scraper checks the results page for PDF file links.

5. Displaying Results

   * Extracted case details are cleaned (removing empty lines or extra spaces).
   * The data is sent back to the frontend for display in a user-friendly format.

6. Error Handling

   Handles cases where:

     * No matching case is found.
     * PDF is not available.
     * HTML structure changes cause missing elements (`NoneType` errors).
   * Prevents the application from crashing by adding checks before accessing elements.
